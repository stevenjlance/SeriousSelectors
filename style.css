HINT: First, figure out how to select every image element when you hover over it. Then use this pattern to select every div inside of a div inside of a div when you hover over it. Finally, figure out how to select two types of things at the same time. */

/* BONUS POINT EXTENSIONS
## Extensions
Now that your board is looking great and you've become a css selector master, here are some extensions to keep improving your page!
1. Add and change style rules so that the background of the board alternates between three different colors. (For example, a white cell, then a black cell, then a purple cell repeated across the entire board).
2. Add HTML to the index.html file that gives the person looking at your page all of the rules of checkers. This can be done however you want to. Then write your own style rules to make this section of the page look great.
3. Research a selector that we didn't use in this lab, then find a way to use it. Feel free to add HTML as needed to make the selector applicable.
